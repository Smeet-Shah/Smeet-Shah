# üèã Hobbies: 
I love to make projects on things that make my life easier. Anytime I find something annoying, I am actively trying to find a way to automate or code a solution! With that said, I'd love to solve your problems (kind of), reach out!
When I'm procrastinating my code, I love to play badminton, basketball, cricket, workout, and basically anything that involves something moving!

# üíª Projects:
I have a bunch of projects ready to post, just waiting on getting my last laptop fixed with all my files üò•

PORTFOLIO COMING SOON...
